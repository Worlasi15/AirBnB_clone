This project involves us building a copy of the airbnb website which wont have to implement all the features of the airbnb website but the appropriate
ones to cover what we have been studying so far. This project comprise of a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, a front -end ebsite
that displays the finished product and a database to keep data as well as an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data you create, delte, edit and retrieve.

Command Interpreter(Description): this provides a command line that helps the user interact with the program by inputting commands in text lines
while the command interpreter executes the commands the user input. On Windows, the command prompt is issued by searching for cmd on your keyboard in the start menu.
with Unix and linux, you can search for terminal inin your application Menu or just entering ctrl + Alt + T on your keyboard
On macOS, you issue the command interpreter by doing cmd + S

HOW TO USE A COMMAND INTERPRETER: the command interpreter is used to enable users to interact with the computer operating system. To use this, one has to
type out their commands on the command line interpreter and press enter for it to be executed. Type any command, followed by any options and arguments needed.
commands typically follows a format therefore one must follow that format.
